# ScaleUpStack/Annotations


## About

This library allows to read annotations in the classical DocBlock style including an extended multi-line declaration.

The built-in set of supported annotations can be extended easily by project-specific extensions.


## Installation

Use [Composer] to install this library:

```
$ composer require scaleupstack/annotations dev-master
```


## Introduction

TODO: to be done


## Current State

This library is not yet documented and still under development. It will evolve in the context of [Metadata] and [EasyObject]

Currently two built-in annoations are implemented:

* @method

* @property-read
